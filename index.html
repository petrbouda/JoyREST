            <h4>About</h4>
            <p>
                JoyRest is a lightweight and convenient tool for <code>creating REST services</code> by a concise way.
                The main intention is to provide framework which is simply extensible for different types of DI and servers.
                JoyRest is purely developed using <code>Java programming language 8 and with lambdas</code>.
                Thank to this technology the framework is able to provide very clear API which allows you to defined your
                endpoints through a <code>functional way</code>.

        <h4>Strongly typed and strict framework</h4>

        <p>
            Maybe someone may find strict declaring of Request/Response types as a verbose and annoying activity, but this is the
            biggest advantage of JoyRest. Since this strict defining types allows to JoyRest resolve Writes/Readers during
            an application bootstrapping and not during a Request processing. This is a trade-off between an additional written code
            and a performance impact.
        </p>
        <p>
            <code>JoyRest has chose the better performance !!</code>
        </p>

        <p>
            <i><b>In addition</b></i> the strongly-typed nature of JoyRest allows us to use some <code>Automatic Documentation Generator</code>
            because all information about routes are available immediately after the creation of dependency injection context.
            <br />
            Don't forget to try out <a href="http://localhost:4000/tutorial/maven.html">JoyRest-Maven-Plugin</a> which provides
            extensible functionality of generation documentation.

        <h4>Lambda-based</h4>

        <p>
            There are three ways to define a body of the given route. Even if it's the <code>lambda-based approach</code>
            of defining routes the most favourite concept, it also worth mentioning other two approaches. For the sake of simplicity
            and conciseness my favourite is Lambda! Try it out or look at the
            <a href="https://github.com/petrbouda/joyrest/tree/master/joyrest-examples">Examples on GitHub</a>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>lambda-based approach</li>
            <li>method reference</li>
            <li>implementing BiConsumer interface</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Clear java interface configuration</h4>

        <p>
            JoyRest prefers the way without or at least eliminate a number of annotations used during the declaring
            and bootstrapping the application. Annotations can be sometimes very confusing and make harder following debugging
            and understanding of the code underneath.
