    <h3 id="sec1">About</h3>
    JoyRest is a lightweight and convenient tool for <code>creating REST services</code> by a concise way.
    The main intention is to provide framework which is simply extensible for different types of DI and servers.
    JoyRest is purely developed using <code>Java programming language 8 and with lambdas</code>.
    Thank to this technology the framework is able to provide very clear API which allows you to defined your
    endpoints through a <code>functional way</code>.

    <h3 id="sec2">Example</h3>
<pre><code class="language-java">
public class JokeController extends TypedControllerConfiguration {

    @Inject
    private JokeService service;

    @Override
    protected void configure() {
        setGlobalPath("jokes");

        post((req, resp) -> {
            Joke savedJoke = service.save(req.getEntity());
            resp.entity(singletonList(savedJoke))
                .status(CREATED)
                .header(LOCATION, getEntityLocation(savedJoke.getId(), req.getPath()));
        }, Req(Joke.class), RespList(Joke.class))
                .consumes(JSON).produces(JSON);

        get((req, resp) -> {
            List<Joke> jokes = service.getAll();
            resp.entity(jokes);
        }, RespList(Joke.class)).produces(JSON, XML);

        get("{id}", (req, resp) -> {
            Joke joke = service.get(req.getPathParam("id"));
            resp.entity(joke);
        }).produces(JSON, XML);
    }

    private String getEntityLocation(String entityId, String path) {
        return path + "/" + entityId;
    }
}</code></pre>

    <h3 id="sec3">Easy Integration</h3>
    One of the main requirements of this framework is easy integration with other tools such as DI framework or
    Servers.
    A clue how to integrate a new DI or Server is covered in a particular section <a href="">Integration</a>.
    <h4>Dependency Injection Frameworks</h4>
    Primarily JoyRest was developed using <code>HK2</code> DI but also supports most of the popular DI framework such as
    <code>Spring, Guice, Dagger</code>. To make a support for whatever DI framework is very easy and takes no more than one
    additional special class determined to the given DI framework. Joyrest can be used also without any DI Framework.

    <h4>Servers</h4>
    A Support for both types of servers <code>HTTP Server and Servlet-based Server</code> is covered and whatever server
    can be used for running an application with JoyRest framework.
