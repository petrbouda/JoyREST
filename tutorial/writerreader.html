    <h3 id="github-sec">How to serialize and deserialize an entity</h3>
    This article concerns how to transform a body from an incoming request to entity and how to entity transform and
    save in an outgoing response. We can do that using classes called <code>Reader</code> and <code>Writer</code>.

    <br /><br />
    Reader and Writer have one method in common inherited from interface <code>General</code>. This method is called
    <code>isGeneral</code> and in this particular case it's a flag for whether Reader or Writer is dedicated for
    a concrete entity or for all entities of the given MediaType.

    <br /><br />
    <p>
        There are several available Readers and Writers in the package <code>joyrest-utils</code> apart from <code>StringReaderWriter</code>:
