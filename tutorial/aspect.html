    <code>Aspect</code> is the class which provides a possibility to add some kind of functionality before the <code>RouteAction</code>
    (the body of an endpoint) is called and then add some functionality after the action is called. Aspects are ordered to the
    <code>ActionChain</code> according to their <code>Order</code> number.

    <br /><br />
    The interface <code>ActionChain</code> contains a method
    <code>InternalResponse&lt;Object&gt; proceed(InternalRequest&lt;Object&gt; request, InternalResponse&lt;Object&gt; response)</code>
    that is used to continue in the aspect's chain or in the case when the currently processed aspect is the last, so then
    to process a body of the particular route.

    <p>
        There are several available aspects:
