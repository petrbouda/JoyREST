    <hr/>

    As well as <code>TypedControllerConfiguration</code> class is determined for creation of routes there is also
    <code>TypedExceptionConfiguration</code> abstract class which makes easy a handling of exceptions occurred during request processing
    (e.g. no suitable route was found for a given request - framework exceptions) or which is thrown in route processing
    (developers exceptions).

<pre><code class="language-java">
public class TestExceptionConfiguration extends TypedExceptionConfiguration {

    @Override
    protected void configure() {
        handle(SomeException.class, (req, resp, ex) -> {
            resp.status(HttpStatus.BAD_REQUEST);
            resp.header(HeaderName.of("x-exception-header"), "error");
            resp.entity(new ErrorResponse("reason", "some description"));
        }, Resp(ErrorResponse.class));
    }
}</code></pre>
