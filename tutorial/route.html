    <hr/>
    <div class="bs-callout bs-callout-info">
        <p>
            Controllers are configuration classes which provides all information about routes that have something similar to each other. For example
            resource <code>Joke</code> should have one controller configuration with all operations which are available to do with this resource.
            There is one abstract class <code>TypedControllerConfiguration</code> that makes a route creation very easy because contains
            various combinations of parameters to makes a work with it as convenient as possible. Its usage is shown below.
        </p>
        <p>
            There are several ways to configure the body of the route:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>using a lambda expression</li>
            <li>using a method reference</li>
            <li>using an implementation of the interface <code>BiConsumer&lt;Request&lt;REQ&gt;, Response&lt;RESP&gt;&gt;</code></li>
        </ul>
    </div>

        <p>
            Maybe someone may find strict declaring of Request/Response types as a verbose and annoying activity, but this is the
            biggest advantage of JoyRest. Since this strict defining types allows to JoyRest resolve Writes/Readers during
            an application bootstrapping and not during a Request processing. This is a trade-off between an additional written code
            and a performance impact.

        <code>JoyRest chose a better performance !!</code>

    <h4>Lambda expression example</h4>
<pre><code class="language-java">
public class JokeController extends TypedControllerConfiguration {

    @Inject
    private JokeService service;

    @Override
    protected void configure() {
        get((req, resp) -> {
            List&lt;Joke&gt; jokes = service.getAll();
            resp.entity(jokes);
        }, RespList(Joke.class)).produces(JSON, XML);
    }
}</code></pre>
