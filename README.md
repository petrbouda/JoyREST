### About
JoyRest is a lightweight and convenient tool for **_creating REST services_** by a concise way. The main intention is to provide framework which is simply extensible for different types of DI and servers. JoyRest is purely developed using **_Java programming language 8 and with lambdas_**. Thank to this technology the framework is able to provide very clear API which allows you to defined your endpoints through a **_functional way_**.

### Easy Integration
One of the main requirements of this framework is easy integration with other tools such as DI framework or Servers. A clue how to integrate a new DI or Server is covered in a particular section **_Integration_**.

#### Dependency Injection Frameworks
Primarily JoyRest was developed using `HK2` DI but also supports most of the popular DI framework such as `Spring, Guice, Dagger`. To make a support for whatever DI framework is very easy and takes no more than one additional special class determined to the given DI framework. Joyrest can be used also without any DI Framework.

#### Servers
A Support for both types of servers `HTTP Server and Servlet-based Server` is covered and whatever server can be used for running an application with JoyRest framework.
